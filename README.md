# Code challenge

We made this project with create-react-app (https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Clone the repo, do your work, and then send us a link to your repo so we can run it ourselves.


## Acceptance criteria:

* As a user, when I come the homepage I will see a list of all the Star Wars films, and each film's director.
  * See the API's documentation: (https://swapi.co/documentation)
  * If there is another API you prefer, by all means feel free to use it and display something else in the app.

* As a user when I select a tile, it will appear with these styles, and the unselected tiles appear with these styles.

* As a user, when I fist come to the page, the first tile is selected.

* As a user on a screen width up 1025px, I will see the tiles stacked vertically, aligned to the center of the page.

* As a user on a screen width wider than 1025px, I will see the tiles aligned horizontally, aligned to the center of the page, allowing tiles to wrap to a second row if needed.

* As a user, when I hover over an unselected tile with a mouse, I know that I can click the tile.


## Don't stress!
Just work on meething the acceptance criteria. We don't want you to spend too much time on this.

The point of this exercise is to understand your approach to:
  * Fetching data and displaying it in a UI with React
  * Responsive website layout
  * User experience and user interface design
  * State management

If you don't finish everything in an evening, that's fine. We want to see where you are at and have some code to talk about in person.

We will talk about what you would have done if you had more time.



# creat-react-app documentation
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
